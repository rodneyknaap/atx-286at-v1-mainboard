# ATX form factor 80286 AT mainboard PCB Rev 1

## Current status(march 2024): This project is currently in pre-testing phase, the designs have been ordered from a PCB house.

The project consists of a ATX mainboard and a ISA memory card.

Purpose and permitted use, cautions for a potential builder of this design
This project was created for historical purposes out of love for historical computing designs and for the purpose of enabling computing enthousiasts with a sufficient level of building and troubleshooting expertise to be able to experience the technology by building and troubleshooting the hardware described in this project.

Besides the GPL3 license there are a few warnings and usage restrictions applicable:
No guarantees of function or fitness for any particular or useful purpose is given, building and using this design is at the sole responsibility of the builder.

Do not attempt this project unless you have the necessary electronics assembly expertise and experience, and know how to observe all electronics safety guidelines which are applicable.

It is not permitted to use the computer built from this design without the assumption of the possibility of loss of data or malfunction of the connected device. To be used strictly for personal hobby and experimental purposes only. No applications are permitted where failure of the device could result in damage or injury of any kind.

If you plan to use this design or any part of it in new designs, the acknowledgement of the designer and the design sources and inspirations, historical and modern, of all subparts contained within this design should be included and respected in your publication, to accredit the hard work, time and effort dedicated by the people before you who contributed to make your project possible.

No guarantee for any proper operation or suitability for any possible use or purpose is given, using the resulting hardware from this design is purely educational and experimental and not intended for serious applications. Loss of data is likely and to be expected when connecting any storage device or storage media to the resulting system from this design, or when configuring or operating any storage device or media with the system of this design.

When connecting this system to a computer network which contains stored information on it, it is at the sole responsibility and risk of the person making the connection, no guarantee is given against data loss or data corruption, malfunctions or failure of the whole computer network and/or any information contained inside it on other devices and media which are connected to the same network.

When building this project, the builder assumes personal responsibility for troubleshooting it and using the necessary care and expertise to make it function properly as defined by the design. You can email me with questions, but I will reply only if I have time and if I find the question to be valid. Which will probably also lead to an update here. I want to primarily dedicate my time to new project development, I am not able to do any user support, so that's why I provide the elaborate info here which will be expanded if needed.
